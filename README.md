# Virtual Labs Redesign - Felicity'25 Hackathon

A complete UI/UX overhaul of the Virtual Labs platform, developed during the Felicity'25 Hackathon organized by IIIT Hyderabad. Our solution enhances user experience with an intuitive design, simplified navigation, and integrated virtual assistant support.

## Features

- **Modern UI/UX Design**: A modern, intuitive UI for a more engaging and user-friendly experience. 
- **Mobile-First Navigation**: Optimized for seamless usage on mobile devices with a bottom navigation bar and categorized domain cards for easy access.
- **Simplified Navigation**: A dedicated tab bar offers quick access to broad domains via interactive cards, while dropdown menus group similar labs, minimizing scrolling and enabling users to easily locate experiments. Fixed call-to-action buttons like "Practice" provide one-click access for a seamless experience.
- **VirtuBot - Virtual Assistant**: A built-in virtual assistant that provides instant answers to FAQs, navigational guidance, and context-based prompt suggestions using a curated FAQ dataset.
